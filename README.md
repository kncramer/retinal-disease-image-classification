# Retinal Disease Classification

Retinal eye diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration, and glaucoma are some of the leading causes of vision loss worldwide. Early and accurate detection of these conditions is critical to preventing irreversible damage and to initiate treatment. However, traditional diagnostic methods that rely on manual analysis by optometrists or ophthalmologists can be time-consuming, subjective, or inaccessible to underserved populations.

This project aims to develop an image classification model to identify some of these retinal diseases from fundus photography. The primary focus is on maximizing sensitivity, as missing a diagnosis could lead to severe consequences for patients, including delayed treatment and potential vision loss. Achieving high sensitivity ensures that cases with potential disease are flagged for further review and additional diagnostic testing methods to minimize the risk of overlooked conditions.

Some challenges include:
* Variability in image quality, from different skills in the technician taking the photo, different quality machines, and interfering factors like dust on the imaging lens.
* Differentiating between subtle differences between similar diseases.
* Addressing class imbalance where some diseases are underrepresented.

The goal is to create an additional tool to aid optometrists/ophthalmologists in improving diagnostic accuracy and prioritizing patient health through minimal false negatives.
